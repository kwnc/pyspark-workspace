# Spark in Action, 2nd edition - chapter 10

Welcome to Spark in Action, chapter 10. This chapter is about ingesting streaming data in Apache Spark. Note that the focus of this chapter is on structured streaming (not discretized streaming).

Also contains examples of the usage of the various **sinks** in Spark's structured streaming.

This code is designed to work with Apache Spark v3.0.0.

Notes: 
 1. Due to renaming the packages to match more closely Java standards, this project is not in sync with the book's MEAP prior to v10.
